<h1>Library Management System</h1>
<p>
  This project is for a library management system. HTML, CSS, Bootstrap technologies were used in the frontend of the project, and technologies such as Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, MySQL, Thymeleaf and tools such as Spring Boot Dev Tools, Lombok, ModelMapper, PasswordEncoder, Thymeleaf Security were used in the backend. There are 2 roles in the system. Admin and user roles. The person(s) with the admin role can add an author and book to the system, view and edit information related to the author and book, search by a certain parameter, and delete the author and book from the system. Users can also see information about the author and book and can search based on certain parameters. To use all these functionalities, users must register on our website and then log in to their account. Authorization and authentication are username and password (role) based. But the project will not end there. In the near future, functions such as "Add to/remove card", "Pay" will be added to the system. The frontend part will include functionalities such as pagination and sorting.
